# Ocean Accounts as Infrastructure for the BBNJ Clearing-House Mechanism: A Technical Brief on Data Architecture for Sustainable Ocean Governance

## Executive Summary

The 2023 Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) establishes a Clearing-House Mechanism (CHM) as its digital backbone for transparency, compliance, and benefit-sharing across all treaty functions.¹ Yet the Agreement provides limited technical specifications for CHM implementation, creating risks of fragmented development and missed opportunities for systematic ocean governance.² Ocean Accounts—a structured framework for integrating environmental, economic, and social ocean data aligned with international statistical standards—offers a proven architecture that can operationalize CHM requirements while enabling evidence-based decision-making for sustainable ocean development.³

This brief demonstrates that Ocean Accounts provides essential infrastructure for CHM success through five key synergies: standardized spatial data architecture enabling consistent geographic reporting;⁴ flow accounting systems that can track marine genetic resource utilization chains;⁵ baseline condition accounts supporting robust environmental impact assessments;⁶ asset monitoring frameworks measuring conservation effectiveness;⁷ and standardized indicators facilitating capacity-building and technology transfer.⁸ 

Implementation should proceed through phased development beginning with pilot Ocean Accounts modules integrated into CHM prototypes before COP-1, followed by progressive account compilation in volunteer countries, and ultimately achieving a fully integrated system supporting real-time monitoring and decision support.⁹ Critical near-term actions include establishing an Ocean Accounts-CHM Technical Working Group under the Preparatory Commission, developing data standards based on System of Environmental-Economic Accounting principles, and securing resources for system development prioritizing participation by Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.¹⁰

The integration of Ocean Accounts and CHM represents more than technical alignment—it establishes a foundation for transformative ocean governance that bridges the persistent divide between environmental protection and sustainable development through systematic, comparable, and actionable information.

## 1. Introduction: The Data Challenge of BBNJ Implementation

The Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, adopted in June 2023, represents the most significant advance in ocean governance since UNCLOS itself.¹¹ The BBNJ Agreement addresses governance gaps in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) through four interconnected pillars: marine genetic resources (MGRs) including benefit-sharing; area-based management tools (ABMTs) including marine protected areas; environmental impact assessments (EIAs); and capacity-building and technology transfer (CB&TT).¹²

Central to implementing these pillars is the Clearing-House Mechanism, described as an "essential orchestration tool" that will serve as the treaty's digital backbone.¹³ Article 51 establishes the CHM as an open-access platform facilitating access to information across all treaty elements.¹⁴ Yet despite its centrality, the Agreement provides minimal technical specifications for CHM architecture, leaving critical design decisions to future Conference of Parties meetings.¹⁵

This implementation gap poses significant risks. Without standardized data architecture, the CHM may evolve as a fragmented collection of databases rather than an integrated system. Different parties may develop incompatible reporting formats, undermining comparability. The absence of common standards could perpetuate existing asymmetries where technologically advanced states dominate ocean science while developing states lack capacity to participate meaningfully in governance processes.

Ocean Accounts offers a solution. Developed through the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership and aligned with the System of National Accounts (SNA) and System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), Ocean Accounts provides a structured framework for compiling and integrating ocean data across environmental, economic, and social domains.¹⁶ Unlike ad-hoc data compilations, Ocean Accounts employs accounting principles ensuring completeness, consistency, and comparability while maintaining flexibility for national circumstances.¹⁷

The framework's relevance to BBNJ implementation extends beyond technical compatibility. Ocean Accounts addresses the fundamental information requirements for sustainable ocean development: measuring economic output from ocean activities, assessing benefit distribution across communities, and tracking sustainability through changes in natural capital assets over time.¹⁸ These capabilities directly support CHM functions including MGR benefit-sharing calculations, EIA baseline establishment, and ABMT effectiveness monitoring.¹⁹

This brief argues that Ocean Accounts provides essential infrastructure for CHM success, offering a proven architecture that can accelerate implementation while ensuring the integrated, transparent, and equitable ocean governance envisioned by the BBNJ Agreement. The following analysis examines CHM requirements, Ocean Accounts capabilities, and their synergistic potential, providing practical recommendations for integration that can transform how humanity governs two-thirds of the planet's surface.

## 2. The BBNJ Clearing-House Mechanism: Requirements and Functions

### 2.1 Core CHM Functions

The BBNJ Agreement assigns the Clearing-House Mechanism comprehensive responsibilities spanning all four treaty pillars, establishing it as the central nervous system for treaty implementation. The following table consolidates CHM functional requirements across the BBNJ framework:

<div class="table-container" style="overflow-x: auto;">

| **BBNJ Pillar** | **CHM Function** | **Data Requirements** | **Timing/Frequency** | **Key Challenges** |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Marine Genetic Resources (MGRs)** | Pre-collection notification | • Research objectives<br>• Geographic coordinates<br>• Target organisms<br>• Sponsoring entities<br>• Vessel/platform details | 6 months before collection | Verification of intent vs. actual collection |
| | Post-collection notification | • Samples collected<br>• Repository locations<br>• Preliminary findings<br>• Data availability | Within 1 year of collection | Tracking sample movements |
| | Utilization notification | • Commercial development<br>• Patent applications<br>• Product information<br>• Benefit-sharing data | Upon commercialization | Linking to batch IDs across databases |
| | Batch ID generation | Standardized identifiers linking samples from collection through utilization | Automatic upon notification | Integration with patent/publication databases |
| **Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs)** | Proposal repository | • Scientific justification<br>• Boundaries/coordinates<br>• Conservation objectives<br>• Traditional knowledge | Upon submission | Harmonizing diverse data formats |
| | Designation records | • COP decisions<br>• Management measures<br>• Stakeholder input | After COP meetings | Coordination with sectoral bodies |
| | Effectiveness monitoring | • Ecological indicators<br>• Compliance data<br>• Adaptive management | Annual/periodic | Standardizing metrics across regions |
| **Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)** | Screening documentation | • Activity description<br>• Initial assessment<br>• Threshold analysis | Project initiation | Transparency vs. commercial sensitivity |
| | Full EIA reports | • Baseline data<br>• Impact analysis<br>• Mitigation measures<br>• Monitoring plans | Before activity approval | Quality assurance without verification capacity |
| | Monitoring data | • Actual impacts<br>• Compliance reports<br>• Adaptive measures | Ongoing during activity | Real-time data integration |
| **Capacity-Building & Technology Transfer (CB&TT)** | Needs assessment | • Technical gaps<br>• Infrastructure requirements<br>• Training priorities | Annual submission | Matching diverse capacity levels |
| | Resource matching | • Available expertise<br>• Funding opportunities<br>• Technology offerings | Continuous updates | Dynamic matching algorithms |
| | Progress tracking | • Training completed<br>• Technology deployed<br>• Outcome indicators | Periodic reporting | Measuring effectiveness vs. inputs |

</div>

Each function requires sophisticated technical architecture supporting multi-stakeholder access, traditional knowledge integration, and interoperability with existing ocean governance systems (Gaebel et al. 2025).

### 2.2 Technical Requirements

Implementing these functions demands sophisticated technical architecture that the Agreement leaves largely unspecified. The CHM must achieve interoperability with existing databases across multiple organizations while maintaining its own data integrity and accessibility standards. The standardized batch identifier system requires integration with patent databases, scientific publication indexes, and commercial product registries to track MGR utilization comprehensively (Humphries et al. 2024). Multi-stakeholder access protocols must accommodate diverse users from government agencies to indigenous communities, each with different technical capacities and information needs.

Data quality and validation mechanisms represent particular challenges given the CHM's reliance on self-reporting. Without verification capabilities, the notification system risks becoming a repository of incomplete or inaccurate information undermining treaty objectives. The CHM must also support multiple knowledge systems, integrating quantitative scientific data with qualitative traditional knowledge while respecting intellectual property rights and indigenous data sovereignty (Friedman 2025). These technical requirements extend beyond simple database management, demanding adaptive architecture capable of evolving with technological advances and expanding treaty participation.

### 2.3 Implementation Challenges

The Preparatory Commission's first substantive meeting in April 2025 highlighted critical implementation challenges requiring urgent resolution. Foremost is the absence of specified technical architecture, with delegations debating whether to build new infrastructure or adapt existing systems like the CBD's clearing-house mechanisms (IDDRI 2025). This architectural uncertainty compounds resource constraints, as developing states lack capacity to design CHM-compatible national systems while the treaty's financial mechanism remains undefined.

Integration with existing ocean governance systems presents additional complexity. The CHM must interface with the International Seabed Authority's databases for seabed mining, Regional Fisheries Management Organizations' catch documentation systems, International Maritime Organization's shipping registries, and numerous scientific data repositories, each with distinct standards and access protocols. The "not undermining" provision (Article 5) requires the CHM to respect existing legal frameworks while promoting coherence, a delicate balance demanding careful institutional orchestration (Kim 2024).

Capacity constraints particularly affect Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries, which may lack technical infrastructure, trained personnel, and financial resources for CHM participation. Without targeted support, these states risk exclusion from the benefits of BBNJ implementation despite their significant ocean territories and traditional knowledge. The High Seas Alliance emphasizes that ensuring equitable access requires not just technical solutions but sustained capacity-building investments and simplified interfaces accommodating varying technological capabilities (High Seas Alliance 2025).

Perhaps most fundamentally, the CHM faces the challenge of building trust in a system based on self-reporting and voluntary compliance. Foster (2025) observes that while the BBNJ Agreement imposes "light substantive duties," it creates "heavy procedural obligations" whose effectiveness depends entirely on transparent implementation. The CHM must therefore incorporate accountability mechanisms that encourage compliance while avoiding bureaucratic burdens that might discourage participation. This requires careful balance between comprehensiveness and usability, transparency and confidentiality, standardization and flexibility.

These implementation challenges are not merely technical but deeply political, reflecting different visions of ocean governance and benefit-sharing. Yet they also present opportunities for innovation. By adopting proven frameworks like Ocean Accounts, the CHM can leverage existing investments in ocean information systems while establishing new standards for integrated governance. The following section examines how Ocean Accounts addresses these challenges through systematic architecture aligned with international standards.

## 3. Ocean Accounts Framework: A Systems Approach to Ocean Information

### 3.1 Conceptual Architecture

Ocean Accounts represents a paradigm shift from fragmented ocean statistics to integrated information systems, providing structured methodology for measuring relationships between ocean environments, economies, and societies. The framework's foundation rests on fundamental accounting distinctions between stocks—assets measured at points in time—and flows—transfers of goods, services, or activities measured over periods (OA-Guidance). This distinction enables systematic tracking of how ocean natural capital changes through human use and environmental processes, directly supporting sustainability assessments required for BBNJ implementation.

The spatial data framework employs Basic Spatial Units (BSUs) as foundational building blocks, enabling three-dimensional ocean representation through depth layers that accommodate complex marine ecosystem structures. BSUs can be aggregated or disaggregated according to management needs, from local bay systems to entire exclusive economic zones, providing the geographic flexibility essential for CHM reporting across scales. This spatial architecture maintains consistency with the Global Ecosystem Typology's functional classifications while allowing integration of indigenous and local spatial knowledge systems that may not conform to conventional cartographic boundaries (OA-Guidance: Section 3.5).

Central to Ocean Accounts' integrative capacity is its alignment with established international standards, particularly the System of National Accounts 2025 and System of Environmental-Economic Accounting frameworks. This compatibility ensures that ocean-specific information connects seamlessly with broader economic and environmental statistics, avoiding the isolation that often marginalizes ocean data from mainstream policy processes. The framework explicitly bridges the production boundary defined by SNA with environmental processes occurring beyond human economies, capturing previously invisible relationships between ecosystem functioning and economic activity (Fenichel et al. 2020).

### 3.2 Key Components Relevant to CHM

Ocean Accounts' component structure directly addresses CHM information requirements through systematic organization of diverse data types. The following table maps Ocean Accounts components to their CHM applications:

<div class="table-container" style="overflow-x: auto;">

| **Component Type** | **Description** | **CHM Application** | **Data Sources** | **Example Metrics** |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Environmental Assets** | Stocks of marine ecosystems and resources measured at points in time | • EIA baseline establishment<br>• ABMT designation support<br>• Conservation monitoring | • Remote sensing<br>• In-situ monitoring<br>• Research surveys | • Coral reef extent (km²)<br>• Fish stock biomass (tonnes)<br>• Habitat condition indices |

</div>

This systematic organization enables Ocean Accounts to transform diverse ocean data into standardized, comparable information directly supporting CHM functions across all BBNJ pillars (OA-Guidance: Section 3.5).

### 3.3 Implementation Approaches

Ocean Accounts' modular architecture enables adaptive implementation matching institutional capacities and policy priorities, a flexibility essential for diverse BBNJ parties. Countries typically begin with pilot accounts addressing specific challenges—sustainable fisheries, coastal tourism, marine pollution—before expanding coverage systematically (OA-Guidance: Section 3.7). This incremental approach allows learning-by-doing while building technical capacity and stakeholder engagement, avoiding the paralysis that comprehensive implementation demands might create.

Implementation models vary according to institutional arrangements, with some countries positioning national statistics offices as leads emphasizing economic dimensions, while others operate through environment agencies prioritizing ecological accounts. Multi-agency collaborative approaches under high-level coordination increasingly emerge as best practice, recognizing that ocean accounts span traditional bureaucratic boundaries. For CHM integration, this institutional flexibility suggests that parties can build on existing ocean information systems rather than creating parallel structures, reducing implementation costs while leveraging established expertise.

The framework's "rapid assessment" option using global datasets enables countries with limited resources to establish baseline accounts quickly before developing detailed national compilations. This tiered approach ensures that all parties can participate in Ocean Accounts-based CHM reporting regardless of technical capacity, addressing equity concerns central to BBNJ negotiations. Progressive refinement from rapid assessments to comprehensive accounts creates natural capacity-building pathways, with early adopters supporting later implementers through technical cooperation facilitated by the CHM itself.

## 4. Synergies: Mapping Ocean Accounts Components to CHM Functions

The Ocean Accounts Framework comprises twelve interconnected components that collectively provide comprehensive infrastructure for CHM operationalization.²⁰ The following interactive visualization and table demonstrate how these components flow through BBNJ pillars to support specific CHM functions:

```js
import {createSankeyDiagram} from "./components/sankey-diagram.js";
const flowData = await FileAttachment("data/oa-chm-flows.json").json();
const diagram = createSankeyDiagram(flowData, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 800,
  nodeWidth: 20,
  nodePadding: 15
});
display(diagram);
```

### Component-to-Function Mapping Details

The Sankey diagram above visualizes data flows from Ocean Accounts components (left) through BBNJ pillars (center) to CHM functions (right). Flow width indicates relative importance and data volume. The following table provides detailed mapping specifications:

<div class="table-container" style="overflow-x: auto;">

| **OA Component** | **Primary CHM Functions** | **Secondary Functions** | **Data Flow Type** | **Integration Priority** |

</div>

### Integration Architecture

The visualization reveals three critical insights for CHM implementation:

1. **Convergence Points**: Multiple OA components converge at each BBNJ pillar, demonstrating the integrated nature of ocean governance. No single component suffices; systematic integration is essential.

2. **Flow Intensity**: The thickness of flows indicates data volume and importance. Spatial framework and environmental assets show highest flow volumes, confirming their foundational role in CHM architecture.

3. **Distribution Patterns**: CHM functions receive inputs from multiple pillars, highlighting the need for cross-pillar data integration. Traditional siloed approaches will fail to capture these interdependencies.

Through systematic integration of these twelve components, Ocean Accounts transforms CHM from a passive repository to an active intelligence system supporting evidence-based ocean governance.⁴⁸

</div>

### Solution Integration Strategy

Ocean Accounts provides systematic approaches to each challenge category through:

1. **Technical solutions** leveraging established SEEA standards and flexible architecture accommodating diverse national contexts while maintaining global comparability.

2. **Institutional solutions** building on existing statistical and environmental accounting frameworks, reducing duplication while enhancing coordination.

3. **Equity solutions** ensuring meaningful participation through tiered implementation, regional cooperation, and respect for diverse knowledge systems.

Success requires recognizing these challenges as opportunities for innovation rather than barriers to implementation, with Ocean Accounts providing the structured framework for systematic solutions.

## 7. Recommendations and Conclusion

### 7.1 Policy Recommendations

The Preparatory Commission and first Conference of Parties should formally adopt Ocean Accounts Framework principles as the foundational data architecture for CHM development, providing the standardization essential for systematic implementation while maintaining flexibility for national circumstances. This adoption need not require comprehensive Ocean Accounts implementation immediately but should establish accounting principles—stocks versus flows, spatial consistency, temporal comparability—as design requirements shaping CHM technical specifications.

Establishing an Ocean Accounts-CHM Technical Working Group under PrepCom auspices with balanced representation from developed and developing countries, technical experts and policy practitioners, would provide the collaborative mechanism needed to develop detailed integration protocols before COP-1 decisions lock in architectural choices. This group's mandate should extend beyond technical specifications to encompass capacity-building strategies, resource mobilization plans, and equity safeguards ensuring that integration serves all parties rather than privileging those with existing accounting systems.

Pilot projects in volunteer countries representing diverse contexts—SIDS with traditional knowledge systems, developed countries with established accounts, regional collaborations pooling resources—should commence immediately to generate practical lessons informing broader implementation. These pilots should receive dedicated support from the BBNJ financial mechanism once established, demonstrating that Ocean Accounts-CHM integration represents a priority investment in treaty effectiveness rather than an optional enhancement.

### 7.2 Technical Recommendations

CHM data standards should build on SEEA principles while extending them for BBNJ-specific requirements, particularly around MGR tracking, traditional knowledge integration, and governance indicators not traditionally included in environmental-economic accounts. API specifications enabling automated data exchange between national Ocean Accounts and the global CHM should prioritize simplicity and reliability over sophisticated features that might exclude parties with limited technical infrastructure.

Modular implementation approaches allowing countries to begin with basic components—spatial framework, key ecosystem assets, priority economic flows—before adding complexity reduces entry barriers while building toward comprehensive coverage. This modularity should extend to the CHM interface, where simple data entry options coexist with sophisticated automated feeds, ensuring that all parties can participate regardless of technical capacity.

Data quality assurance protocols must balance scientific rigor with practical constraints, accepting that imperfect data systematically compiled provides more value than perfect data sporadically available. Ocean Accounts' emphasis on documenting uncertainty and data quality through metadata provides a model for maintaining transparency about information limitations while avoiding paralysis from pursuing unattainable perfection.

### 7.3 Conclusion

Ocean Accounts offers more than technical solutions to CHM implementation challenges—it provides a conceptual framework for transforming how humanity understands and governs ocean spaces that belong to all yet are managed by none. By systematically documenting relationships between ocean ecosystems, human economies, and social wellbeing, integrated Ocean Accounts-CHM systems can shift ocean governance from reactive regulation of problems to proactive management of opportunities.

The convergence of Ocean Accounts methodological maturity with BBNJ implementation urgency creates unprecedented opportunity for establishing ocean information architecture supporting sustainable development for generations. Success requires immediate action, sustained commitment, and inclusive collaboration ensuring that standardized systems serve diverse needs rather than imposing uniformity that marginalizes difference.

Ultimately, Ocean Accounts-CHM integration represents investment in ocean governance infrastructure as fundamental as ports and research vessels—invisible yet essential foundations enabling evidence-based decisions about humanity's largest shared resource. The choice facing BBNJ parties is not whether to integrate these systems but how quickly ambition can match the urgency of ocean challenges demanding systematic solutions.
