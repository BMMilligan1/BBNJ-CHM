## Ocean Accounts Framework
- The Ocean Accounts Framework components could benefit from more granular and accurate description that map onto the higher level categories of the ocean accounts framework: 
  - The article does not engage sufficiently with the functional perspective on Ocean Accounts - i.e. how diverse data sources are processed through validation and sharing (applying statistical principles and standards) to produce standardized OA tables and other data structure / interfaces, and then indicators and reports for multiple decision processes. Which types of indicators might be particularly useful for the CHM and other components of BBNJ Agreement implementation?
  - The article plucks conceptual components of the OA Framework out but doesn't leave the reader with a clear sense of how these components fit together to produce the OA Framework as a whole. The components of OA used in the Sankey diagram should be the same as they appear in the text of TG001 of the GOAP Ocean Accounting Guidance: i.e. spatial data framework, environmental assets (extent and condition), social assets and conditions, produced and financial assets, flows within the economy, social activities beyond the SNA, flows and interactions within the environment, etc etc (these are all described very clearly in the GOAP Guidance). Specific subcomponents from the OA framework should be highlighted as particularly relevant to the CHM and BBNK agreement implementation, and not cherry picked without a broader sense of how the framework is structured as a whole. The text should flow naturally from the sankey diagram which provides the high level overview of interconnections. 
  - Speaking of the Sankey diagram, every component of OA is currently connected to every component of the BBNJ agreement. This is a bit misleading and warrants further explanation. For example, the "social assets and conditions" component of OA is not directly relevant to the CHM necessarily, so it should not be connected in the Sankey diagram. The connections should be more selective and meaningful, reflecting the actual relationships between OA components and BBNJ Agreement elements.
- In many of the tables, the text only contains brief bulleted phrases which are difficult to interpret easily. Tables in general should be used to present conceptually complete short sentences, not fragments. Consider a re-design of tables as a whole to reflect this, unless the meaning is completely unambiguous. For example, what exactly is "boundary delineation" in the secondary functions of the spatial data framework for CHM functions? This could mean a number of things. 
- Regional implementation examples are not particularly useful now are they well integrated into the flow of the article. Instead there should be some practical discussion of exactly how OA processes at a country level could start to be gradually expanded to incorporate BBNJ relevant information (e.g. extent and condition beyond national jurisdiction) and how information that is within the scope of national OA implementation could be leveraged to support BBNJ implementation. The current text is very vague and not focused on CHM implementation specifically.
